### Future plans
#### In the next stage of the Stay Manager project, the focus will be on optimizing the backend for improved performance. This will involve the strategic use of data structures and algorithms to streamline data processing, reduce latency, and enhance the overall speed of the website. By implementing efficient algorithms, the goal is to make the platform more responsive and capable of handling increased traffic, ultimately providing a faster and more reliable user experience.
